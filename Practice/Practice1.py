1. We need to link each number with its original index.

[1, 1]
[2, 2]
[2, 3]
[3, 4]
[4, 5]
[5, 6]

Structure a node that represents the value and original index.

If we use a tuple we can more easily setup a function.

Node: (value, location)
We'll have:

    


Original Array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Queue = [(1,1), (2,2), (2,3)]





Loop x times
pop the array values
1, 2, 2, 3, 4



------------------------



We know the returned array will ONLY have X values.
We know these values ONLY represent the "original" array index #


We can setup a node that stores:
    Value
    Original Index, if we have 2 values

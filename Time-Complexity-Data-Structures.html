ARRAYS
-----------------------------
Set, Check element at a particular index: O(1)

Searching: O(n) if array is unsorted and O(log n) if array is sorted 
and something like a binary search is used


-------------------------------
ArrayList:
Add: Amortized O(1)
Remove: O(n)
Contains: O(n)
Size: O(1)


------------------------------
Linked List:
Inserting: O(1), if done at the head, O(n) 
if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Deleting: O(1), if done at the head, O(n) 
if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Searching: O(n)


-------------------------------
Doubly-Linked List:
Inserting: O(1), if done at the head or tail, O(n) 
if anywhere else since we have to reach that position 
by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.

Deleting: O(1), if done at the head or tail, O(n) 
if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Searching: O(n)

-----------------------
Stack:
Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Top: O(1)
Search: O(n)

-----------------------
Queue/Deque/Circular Queue:
Insert: O(1)
Remove: O(1)
Size: O(1)

----------------------
Binary Search Tree:
Insert, delete and search: Average case: O(log n), Worst Case: O(n)

Red-Black Tree:
Insert, delete and search: Average case: O(log n), Worst Case: O(log n)


-----------
Heap/PriorityQueue (min/max):
Find Min/Find Max: O(1)
Insert: O(log n)
Delete Min/Delete Max: O(log n)
Extract Min/Extract Max: O(log n)
Lookup, Delete (if at all provided): O(n), 
we will have to scan all the elements as they are not ordered like BST

HashMap/Hashtable/HashSet:
Insert/Delete: O(1) amortized
Re-size/hash: O(n)
Contains: O(1)
